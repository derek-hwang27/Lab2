                <h2>Living in a Society - 4/7/21</h2>
                <p>In this world we call college, there are people, broke people, but people none the less. We work day and night,      mostly night but that's ok. That's the life we've signed up for. For the greater good, we must resign ourselves to this reality now. It is simply what must be done. Do not hate the system. It is what it is.

                <h3><strong>Parting Wisdom</strong></h3>
                <p>For some ending thoughts, I figure I should give some sort of parting wisdom. Today's parting wisdom will be to pick up a hobby/game to destress. I recommed Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle(<i><a href="https://t.co/MTMuNzswsl?amp=1">„Éâ„É©„Ç¥„É≥„Éú„Éº„É´ZÔºö„Éâ„ÉÉ„Ç´„É≥„Éê„Éà„É´</i></a>). It's nearing it's <em>6th year</em> and it's pretty fun to play. The 6 year anniversery will be in July so look forward to it. I've also included a hilarious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYhAIsGWHDw&list=LL&index=4">song</a> about the game (it's Japanese dubbed). In the mean time enjoy some rain music to also help you destress.</p>
